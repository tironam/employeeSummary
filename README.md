# Employee Template Generator

## About

This project creates a command line prompt that allows the user to build up a list of their team members. The user answers questions in the terminal, then it delivers them an html file with all of the entered info.

Anyone is free to use this code to build out their team

## Tests

I had trouble with the employee.test.js file, but was able to get all the other files to test properly. I have yet to figure out what's going wrong with that file.
