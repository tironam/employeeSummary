# Employee Template Generator

This project required us to create an Employee Template Generator. The idea is that the user would answer questions in a command line prompt and it would generate a stylized html doc with that information printed neatly. It would ask them for info on their manager, then the engineers and interns, allowing them to add as many team members as they would like. 

## Tests

I had trouble with the employee.test.js file, but was able to get all the other files to test properly. I have yet to figure out what's going wrong with that file.
