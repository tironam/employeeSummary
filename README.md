# Employee Template Generator

## About

This project creates a command line prompt that allows the user to build up a list of their team members. The user answers questions in the terminal, then it delivers them an html file with all of the entered info.

This way, they could be presented with the proper questions to answer based on the role they chose. Despite already knowing which role they've picked, the user still has to enter the title of the employee to meet all the parameters set by the manager or engineer or intern.js files. I initially had it just assign the

Once you've cloned the repo, make sure to do an 'npm init -y' to initiate npm, and then 'npm i' to download the packages. Inquirer and Jest were used for this project.

Anyone is free to use this code to build out their team

## Tests

I had trouble with the employee.test.js file, but was able to get all the other files to test properly. I have yet to figure out what's going wrong with that file.
